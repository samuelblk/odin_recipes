    <p>The crowd favourite - Penne in a silky tomato sauce, with a hint of chilli and depth of vodka.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 box dried penne or similar</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>1 golden shallot or 1/2 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>pinch chilli flakes</li>
        <li>4 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cheap vodka</li>
        <li>100ml pouring or sour cream</li>
        <li>parmesan, grated</li>
        <li>fresh herbs to serve</li>
    </ul>

<h3>How To</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan or casserole dish. Add the shallot and a large pinch of salt and gently fry over a low heat for 10 mins or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and chilli flakes and cook for 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Stir through the tomato purée, cook for 2 mins, then stir through the vodka and cook for 3 mins. Quickly stir through the cream to combine, then remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta in salted water following pack instructions. Drain and reserve 150ml cooking water. Add roughly 50ml of the water to the tomato sauce, then tip in the pasta and cheese, tossing everything together over a low heat until well coated and glossy (loosen with a splash more of the cooking water if it’s a little dry).</li>
        <li>Season to taste, then serve with a sprinkling of the extra parmesan, a good grinding of black pepper and the basil leaves scattered over the top</li>
