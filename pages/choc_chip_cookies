    <p>After dinner, or before, or whenever - Salty and chewy choc chip cookies. </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>226g unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>250g light brown sugar</li>
        <li>175g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>300g AP flour</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1.5 cups dark choc chips, divded</li>
        <li>Sea salt flakes, NOT optional</li>
    </ul>

<h3>How To</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Whisk the flour, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk brown and white sugar in a large bowl and make sure to break up any large chunks with your fingers if needed. Add the melted butter and whisk vigorously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Whisk in one egg to the sugar-butter mixture at a time, stirring until it’s fully mixed in. Whisk in the second egg and the vanilla and scrape the sides of bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir with the spatula to fully combine. Stir in 1 cup of the chocolate chips and save the other cup for putting on top after baking.</li>
        <li>Scoop out dough into cookie dough balls. I like to make big cookies so I use 1/4 cup to scoop out the dough. Place on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Refrigerate dough for at least 15 minutes while the oven heats up.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookie 3 inches apart on a parchment paper lined baking sheet for 10 to 14 minutes. Remove from oven when the edges are set and the cookie is beginning to turn golden brown throughout.</li>
        <li>Top the cookies with flaky sea salt. Let cool on the sheet for 1-2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
